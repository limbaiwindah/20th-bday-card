                    <h3>bday cards</h3>
                    <p>normally people give birthday cards to the person celebrating it; but this year, I'm going to write a bday cards
                        to anyone my status/stories can reach - because i am turning 20, but i feel like i grew up too fast that i couldn't
                        remember my yesterdays, and i certainly won't know about tomorrows. all i have is this moment, but im not sure what
                        to do with this present.
